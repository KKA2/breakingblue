Level One: Tutorial/The Great Escape

Open (short, black and white animation/history when game first ope):
	Long Ago...
	In a time lost since forgotten...
	There were simply the Figures.

	All lived in harmony...
	And society flourished.
	Technology, industry, the arts...
	All rising to ever-greater heights.

	No one knows how it happened.
	Perhaps an invention gone wrong.
	Perhaps a quirk of evolution.

	When the Coloration came, none were spared.

	Battle lines were drawn.
	
	Eons passed.

	A continual state of war...
	
	Bringing us to today.

	To you.
